# Pivot-tables-Summary-Insights
In this project, I analyzed the Superstore sales dataset to understand sales performance across categories, regions, and customer segments. The dataset included columns such as Order ID, Order Date, Category, Region, Segment, Sales, and Profit. First, I cleaned the dataset and converted it into a table to ensure Excel recognized the headers properly. Using Pivot Tables, I analyzed total sales by category, which revealed that the Technology category contributed the highest share of revenue, followed by Furniture and Office Supplies. A separate Pivot Table was created to analyze sales by region and segment, and I applied Conditional Formatting with a color scale to highlight high-performing regions and segments; the West region and Consumer segment were the top performers. To make the dashboard interactive, I added Slicers for Region, Category, and Segment, allowing dynamic filtering of the Pivot Tables. I also calculated Profit Margin as a new column in the dataset, formatted it as a percentage, and created a Pivot Table showing the average profit margin by category and region, which showed that Technology had the highest margins, while Furniture and the Central region underperformed. A Pivot Chart was added to visualize sales by category clearly. Finally, I drew key insights from the analysis: Technology leads in sales, West region generates the most revenue, Consumer segment outperforms others, Furniture has lower margins, and the Central region requires improvement. The completed report was saved as both an Excel file and a PDF, providing a clear, interactive, and professional dashboard summarizing sales performance and profitability.
